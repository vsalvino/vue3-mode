vue3-mode.el
============

Vue.js syntax highlighting for Emacs. Inspired by [vue-mode](https://github.com/AdamNiederer/vue-mode) with support for Vue 3 syntax, based on `polymode` which provides more accurate syntax highlighting and parsing.

Note: you should uninstall `vue-mode` if installing this package.
